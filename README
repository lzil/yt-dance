speed / mirroring tools for Youtube

(useful for learning dance from videos, lecture videos, etc.)

# TO ACTIVATE
Set the following as a bookmark in any browser and 'click' the bookmark on a Youtube video.

~~~

javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.body.appendChild(document.createElement(%27script%27)).src%3D%27https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzil/yt-dance/master/yt-dance.js%27%3B%7D)()%3B

~~~

# TO USE

- 'p' to speed up by 0.1x
- 'q' to slow down by 0.1x
- 'd' to mirror (and again to unmirror) NOTE: USED TO BE 'i' or 'w' BEFORE UPDATE
- 'r' to reset to 1x unmirrored (original video)

- 's' to save current timestamp
- 'g' to go to saved timestamp (defaults to 0:00:00)

- 'h' to toggle help button

- '<space>' now pauses/unpauses video even when not focused on video
- ';' toggles auto-replay (from stop point) capabilities. DEFAULT = OFF

- 'z' to remove this javascript from the video completely

# TROUBLESHOOTING

- it's potentially interacting with another plugin you have. for instance if used with Chrome's youtube speed plugin then things will potentially break
- for other issues, contact me. liangz [at] gatsby.ucl.ac.uk


# TODO
- turn autoplay off?
- get rid of sound on fullscreen
- make useful on other clients as well that are not youtube
